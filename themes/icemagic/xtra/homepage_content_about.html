          Designing policies that can respond to the problems facing society is challenging. Not only are policies difficult to design, it can often be difficult to know whether a policy worked.<br/>

CECAN, The Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus, is transforming the practice of policy evaluation in interconnecting Nexus areas such as food, energy, water and the environment, to make it fit for a complex world.<br/>

By refining existing methods and developing innovative new tools that can be tested on the ground through case studies of practical evaluation, CECAN aims to help us face the future with better evaluation and more effective policy for an improved environment.<br/>
