			<p><strong>The Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus (CECAN), a £3m research centre hosted by the University of Surrey, is transforming the practice of policy evaluation in Nexus areas, to make it fit for a complex world.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>CECAN is pioneering, testing and promoting innovative policy evaluation approaches and methods across Nexus domains such as food, energy, water and the environment, through a series of ‘real-life’ case study projects with co-funders (ESRC, NERC, DEFRA, BEIS, FSA and EA).</strong></p>
			<p><strong>CECAN has been delivering a programme of evaluation methods workshops, training courses in evaluation tools and specialist seminars delivered by international experts, to encourage knowledge sharing and capacity building amongst those working in UK policy making.</strong></p>
