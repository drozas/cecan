			<p><strong>Designing policies that can respond to the highly complex problems facing society is challenging and it can often be difficult to know if they have worked.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>CECAN, The 'Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus', is transforming the practice of policy evaluation in interconnecting 'Nexus' areas such as food, energy, water and the environment, to help address this problem.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>By refining existing social science methods and developing innovative new modelling tools that can be tested on the ground with real life case studies, CECAN aims to help create better evaluation and more effective environmental policies for the future.</strong></p>
